# Deployment

The deployment process on an AWS Linux Instance involves:

- Running a ***script*** that automates the setup of the Dagster application, ensuring consistency and efficiency.
- Create a ***system service file*** that contains information needed to establish a long-running service. This allows the Dagster application to run continuously in the background, even after the user logs out from the system.
- Setting up a ***webhook listener*** linked to a Bitbucket account, which triggers an application rebuild upon successful merge pull request events. When such an event occurs, the Dagster application will automatically rebuild to update the new code. If any job is running when a merge pull request occurs, the rebuild process will be queued until the running job is completed. This ensures that the application is always running the latest code, while preventing disruptions to ongoing jobs.
