dbt (data build tool) is an open-source transformation tool that enables data analysts and engineers to transform, test, and document data in the warehouse more efficiently. It allows users to write modular SQL queries, which it then runs on top of the data in the warehouse, enabling transformations to be defined as code. This approach promotes best practices in software development, such as version control, code review, automated testing, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) for data transformation processes.
